## Repositories

Fork the following repositories to get started:

- **Frontend**: [lbg-car-react-starter](https://github.com/qa-instructor/lbg-car-react-starter)
- **Backend**: [lbg-car-spring-app-starter](https://github.com/qa-instructor/lbg-car-spring-app-starter)

## Application Overview

The application has a three-tier architecture:
1. **Frontend**: React-based user interface.
2. **Backend**: Spring-based API server.
3. **Database**: MySQL database for data persistence.

Your task is to containerize and deploy the frontend, backend, and database.

## Setup Requirements

To complete the setup, you will need:

1. **New Server Setup**:
   - Provision a new server for deploying the containerized application.

2. **Dockerization**:
   - Write `Dockerfile`s for both the frontend and backend applications.
   - Follow Docker best practices to minimize the size of the final built images.

3. **CI/CD with Jenkins**:
   - Write a `Jenkinsfile` to automate the build process for both applications.
   - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define and deploy the application stack.

4. **Database Configuration**:
   - Include a MySQL container in your deployment to act as the database for the application.
   - Configure a mounted volume to persist database data.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Dockerize Applications**:
   - Create `Dockerfile`s for both the frontend and backend.
   - Ensure minimal image sizes by following Docker best practices.

2. **Jenkins Setup**:
   - Write a `Jenkinsfile` to define build and deployment pipelines for the applications.
   - Use `docker-compose` to deploy the services.

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Add a MySQL container in the `docker-compose.yml`.
   - Use a volume to persist MySQL data for reliability.

## Server Configuration

### Jenkins Server
- **SSH Key**: Generate an SSH key pair for Jenkins to securely connect to the deployment server.
  
### Target Deployment Server
- **Docker**: Install `docker` and `docker-compose`.
- **Jenkins User**:
  - Create a `jenkins` user.
  - Add the user to the Docker group.
  - Add the public key from the Jenkins server to the `authorized_keys` of this user.
- **Firewall**: Ensure ports 80 (HTTP) and 8000 (application) are open in the firewall for incoming connections.
