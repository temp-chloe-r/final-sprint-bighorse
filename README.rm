Project Requirements:
Repositories:

Fork the frontend and backend repositories from:
Frontend: lbg-car-react-starter
Backend: lbg-car-spring-app-starter
Application Structure:

The repositories represent the frontend and backend of a three-tier application.
The goal is to containerize both parts and deploy them along with a database.
Tasks to Complete:
Server Setup:
Deploy the application on a new server.
Dockerization:
Create Dockerfiles for both the frontend and backend applications.
Optimize the Docker images to be as small as possible.
Jenkins Configuration:
Write a Jenkinsfile to automate the build process for both applications.
Use docker-compose for deployment configuration.
Database Configuration:
Set up a MySQL container to store the application’s data.
Use a mounted volume to persist the database data.
Server Configuration:
Jenkins Server:

Generate an SSH key pair for Jenkins to use for secure access to the target deployment server.
Target Deployment Server:

Install docker and docker-compose.
Create a jenkins user with Docker permissions and add the Jenkins server’s public key to the authorized keys.
Open ports 80 and 8000 for web traffic, with the necessary firewall rules.
These steps should guide you in setting up, containerizing, and deploying the application with continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) using Jenkins and Docker. Let me know if you need further assistance with any specific part of this setup!
